      <description>If you ever worked with SignalR and IdentityServer4, you probably did some &amp;ldquo;googling&amp;rdquo; around to figure how the heck JWT authentication works.
Especially since, the token might not be anymore in the request&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Authentication&amp;rsquo; attribute, and with SignalR&amp;rsquo;s preference to WebSocket and fallback transport options.
Maybe you found a lot of answers, maybe not.
In any case, the simplest one I have come across with is the following:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23  services.</description>

      <title>ASP.NET Core garbage collection: Deployment in containerized environments</title>

      <description>TL;DR: In containerized environments, try disabling ServerGarbageCollection and check whether there is a notable performance boost. To do so, alter your project file with the following: &amp;lt;PropertyGroup&amp;gt; &amp;lt;ServerGarbageCollection&amp;gt;false&amp;lt;/ServerGarbageCollection&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/PropertyGroup&amp;gt; Most of the times, it is only after you have a working product that you start caring about performance and optimizations.
That being said, I figured out, only recently, that there are two Garbage Collection (GC) modes in ASP.NET Core.
During the investigation of some memory-leaks and sudden upwards memory bursts in our Kubernetes deployment, I came across this great article on Memory Management &amp;amp; GC followed by two more elaborate investigations on containerized environments: Running with Server GC &amp;ndash; Part 0 and Running with Server GC &amp;ndash; Part 1.</description>
